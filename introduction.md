## Engineering design process

### Definition of Design

* To design is to pull together somthing new or to arrange existing things in a new way to satisfy a recognised need of society. [[1]](https://)

* Design established and defines solutions to and pertinent structures for problems not solved before, or new solutions to problems previously solved in a different way. [[2]](https://)

### Purpose of design process

* Breaking big problems down into small and manageable chunks (i.e. Stages and Gates).
* Repeatable and flexible suits for different problems 

### The Players

* **Client** (wants the design conceived)

* **User** (employ or operate what is being designed)

* **Designer** (solves the clients problem in a way which meets the users needs)

> [!NOTE]
> Whilst not considered as one of the direct actors in the design there are others skateholders who may influence (i.e. gorverment, the general public, ..)
