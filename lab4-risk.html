<p><code>Risk Management</code> can be defined as “coordinated activities to direct and control an organisation with regard to risk”.</p>

<h3 id="endnotes-risk-ethics-and-failure">Endnotes: Risk, Ethics and Failure</h3>
<p><code>Risk management</code> is time consuming and can be perceived to get in the way of progress and so might even be ignored * This behaviour touches on being unethical which is the focus of a future topic * One approach is to embrace failure, and report on it as a learning opportunity for yourself and others</p>
<h2 id="topic-8---conceptual-design">Topic 8 - Conceptual Design</h2>
<p align="center">
<IMG src="./assets/w4-risk/lab22.jpg" alt="Ideation" width=70%/>
</p>
<p>The start of the conceptual design marks a transition in the direction of the engineering project. Now the objective is to solve that defined problem * Specifically, the output from the <code>conceptual design</code> is a preferred option * <code>Conceptual design</code> stage which can be broken into two sub-stages * <strong>Ideation</strong> - The development of a range of suitable design options using <code>divergent thinking</code> * <strong>Screening</strong> - The selection of the best design option using <code>convergent thinking</code></p>
<h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The engineering problems are usually complex in nature and will require innovative thinking to solve</li>
<li>Ideation involves a balance between open creative problem solving and the constraints introduced through the design requirements</li>
<li>There are ideation tools to create an inclusive environment where everyone can contribute their best ideas, <em>There are also some creativity tools to help</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING] Even though you might think that these ideas won’t be viable that not a concern just now, you will be able to <code>screen</code> out the worst ideas in the next sub-phrase</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="ideation-tools">Ideation Tools</h4>
<h5 id="brainstorming">BRAINSTORMING</h5>
<p><code>Brainstorming</code> is a good tool for generating ideas when working in teams. To complete a brainstorming activity * Make sure you have the same working space (make sure you have your <code>design problem statement</code> written somewhere to see) * Spend 5 minutes individually coming up with as many ideas as you can that would solve that problem * Then collate these ideas together in a <code>central space</code>. <code>=&gt;</code> Now group these ideas together and have individuals further explain their ideas * After this individual phase open up <code>idea generation</code> to the whole group. * Adding a new idea to an existing one * Keep going even if you think your idea might be not feasible, someone else might be inspired and add their own idea * At the end of this process you should have a page convened in ideas</p>
<h5 id="the-yes-and-tool">THE ‘YES AND’ TOOL</h5>
<p>Another way to build on the ideas of your is through a <code>yes and</code> tool * Get set up with everyone in your design team in the same working space and your design statement written somewhere to see * Individually take a blank piece of paper and write down a single idea to answer the design statement * When you have finished pass the idea to the group member to your left and receive an idea from the group member to your right * Looking at the new idea in front of you add in a suggestion for how this idea could be improved or otherwise build on the idea. To help start your statement with <code>yes and</code> * Repeat the above two steps passing around the ideas and adding onto them until you receive your original ideas * Take it in turn around the design teams to read out the chain of ideas * At the end of this process you should have several developed ideas</p>
<h5 id="scamper">SCAMPER</h5>
<p>Generating an entirely new idea from scratch can be difficult. Using already existing ideas and solutions can with the SCAMPER tool can be very helpful</p>

<li>Simple explanation of <a href="https://youtu.be/vqnIEtlp9d8">SCAMPER</a> tool</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="fields-of-matcemib">FIELDS OF ‘MATCEMIB’</h5>
<p>The tool “8 field of <code>MATCEMIB</code>” is great to increases the number of creative ideas generated by students. To use the tool simply ask yourself “could[Field] help in the meeting <code>design requirement</code>”; where [FIELD] is one of the following * Mechanical * Acoustic * Thermal * Chemical * Electrical * Magnetic * Intermolecular * Biological</p>
<h3 id="creative-problem-solving">Creative Problem Solving</h3>
<p>In design, the critically thinking engineer will constantly review the context and methods that are being used in the project and make adjustment as necessary. The constant battle between <code>creativity</code> and <code>conformity</code>, the engineer must be able to navigate and satisfy both</p>
<h4 id="the-ideal-ultimate-result">The Ideal Ultimate Result</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>critical thinking</code> is important in problem defining</li>
<li><code>creaticity</code> is important is problem solving<br />
</li>
<li><code>Ideal Ultimate Result</code> - a method which aids the designer establish the direction for the system under consideration and also engages the designed in re-framing the situation

<h3 id="level-of-development">Level of Development</h3>
<p>Level of development (LOD) is and idea of how much detail you need to go into during the conceptual design stage. Consider there 3 basics LOD</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>Concpetual design stage</code> - perfectly normal to just be at the lowest level of development, we don’t need more details and we can make estimates of the expected outcomes</li>
<li><code>Preliminary design stage</code> - you will need to start adding more details into the design and you might use functional analysis to the determine the sub function</li>
<li><code>Final design stage</code> - The is a much higher level of development and ultimately at this stage there is enough information that someone could manufacture that part. You would also know the precise cost and weight etc</li>
</ol>
