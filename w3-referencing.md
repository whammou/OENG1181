## Referencing

### Reference Styles  

#### IEEE 

`Reference numbers are set flush left and form a column of their own, hanging out beyond the body of the reference. The reference numbers are on the line, enclosed in square brackets. In all references, the given name of the author or editor is abbreviated to the initial only and precedes the last name. Use commas around Jr., Sr., and III in names. IEEE publications must list names of all authors, up to six names. If there are more than six names listed, use the primary author’s name followed by et al. For non-IEEE publications, et al. may be used if names are not provided. All references, except those ending with URLs, will end with a period, including those with a DOI. However, if a reference contains both a DOI or accessed date, as well as a URL, place the DOI after the URL and end with a period. Note that when citing IEEE Transactions, if the issue number or month is not available, research IEEEXplore to update the information. For any reference that cites two months for the same issue, the two months should be separated by a slash (e.g., Jul./Aug.), followed by the year of publication. References may not include all information; please obtain and include relevant information. Do not combine references. There must be only one reference with each number. If there is a URL included with the print reference, it can be included at the end of the reference (see style for online references).`
