## Topic 14 - Sustainable Practice

> Sustainability is an essential underpinning for quality of life. Societies flourish when activates are sustainable, and all engineering designs need to consider the long-term implications to sustainable development

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
  A commission led by Gro Brundtland resulted in the 1987 publication Our common Future, this is broadly regarded as the foundation of the term sustainable development, defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland, 1987).

### Environmental impact

> [!NOTE]
> __By this stage__ in the topic it is clear why all engineering projects need to be sustainable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> __The Triple Bottom Line concept__, that engineering projects can be assessed on their _costs_ and _benefits_ to the three dimensions of _sustainability_ namely, `economic`, `social`, and `environmental`

#### Environmental Impact Assessment

All engineering projects will have an impact on the environment, in order to quantify these impacts and propose mitigations to negative impacts engineers can conduct `Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA)`.
  * An `EIA` is a decision-making tool which produces a `statement` - Depending on the country, state or context this `statement` might be called differently

In Victory, Australia major projects are required to produce an `Environmental Effects Statement (EES)` in line with the 1978 legislation called the `Environmental Effects Act. Guidance` provided by the `Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP)` indicated that an `EES`[^ees] should be included 

[^ees]:[EES](https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/environment-assessment/what-is-the-ees-process-in-victoria) process in Victoria

  * A description of the proposed development
  * An outline of public and stakeholder consultation undertaken during investigations and the issues raised
  * A description of the existing environment that may be affected
  * Prediction of significant environmental effects of the proposal and relevant alternatives
  * Proposed measures to avoid, minimise or manage adverse environmental effects
  * A Proposed program for monitoring and managing environmental effects during project implementation

## Topic 15 - Preliminary Design: Testing

> Assuming you have decided to test your design there are many ways to do it and there can be many benefits. In this topic we will discuss a few concepts around prototyping as well as enhancing usability of designs. 

### Prototypes

Generating a `prototype` and then getting user feedback tither from a specific user group or a broader cohort can provide valuable insights into how the design may be used

#### Models and Mock Ups

Before you even get to a full scale prototype of your design you might first want to construct a `model` or `mock up`

> [!WARNING]
> Constructing and testing a full prototype can be expensive much better to work out some of the elements on paper

> __Wireframe__
> is a good example of how you might quickly construct a model of a phone app on a piece of paper and show how it can be used

#### Testing Usability

Testing also often leads to an understanding of `modularity` and `replacement parts`.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a growing global movement of 'fixing' devices. The motto of Ifixit is _"if you can't fix it then you don't own it"_ 

<details>
  <summary></<summary><b>Example</b></summary>
  As an example. Wall clocks are a technology which functions well but relies on a replacement component (the battery). Whilst for more than 99.9% of the time a user interacts with a wall clock by looking at it to determine the time once every now and then the user needs to replace the battery. So even though it is not a frequent activity 

  * `(+)` A good designer will include an easy to access panel or battery holder and the replacement could be done in 20 seconds. 

  * `(-)` A poor design would have kept the battery in the middle of the clock which was cheaper to produce but makes it much harder to replace. Making things easy is important and a lot of the 'bugs' can be discovered through basic testing.

#### Accelerated Testing

Sometimes you want to test how  your product will behave not when it is right our of the packaging but maybe five or more years later
  * Modern car brands often offering warranties that last years
    * Most of the car companies don't have 10 years to complete testing on their vehicles so instead they use `numerical simulations` as well as `accelerated testing` to produces years worth of data in a matter of days or weeks
    * `e.g`. `Kia` made this a key part of their car brand

### User Experience

> __User Experience__ 
> is in itself a whole field of design with engineers and designers specialising in User Experience and the ability to pick up qualifications specific to user experience

Human-centered design `HCD` is a design methodology that puts people at the heart of the design
  * In `HCD` all humans affected by a design are considered
    * `e.g`. The users, the maintainers, and the distributors
  * This is a further development of user-centred design, in which the future users are placed at the center of the design process

### Knowledge in the World

> The "knowledge in the world vs the knowledge in the brain"[^book]. Distilling this concept down would be that it is better to indicate how something works or other information about about the function of a product on the product itself rather forcing the user to remember or learn everything

  Moylan arrow, that is the name of the little arrow next to the petrol pump symbol on your cars display which reminds you which side of the car the petrol cap is on. By the way, there is one person reading this whose life has changed because they now know this fact. I mean after all why would you want to have to remember which side the tank is on when that knowledge can be in the world. Yes after a while you might get to know which side yours is on but maybe you rent a car or borrow a car. Guess what? It was an engineer who invented the Moylan arrow and unsurprisingly his name was Moylan.
