# Lecture 5 - Report Writing

## Technical Reports

### Structure

#### PRELIMINARIES

* __Title page__
  * Include: `Title`, `Authors`, `Affiliations`, `Date`
  * University reports: School, Course name and code, Report title, Author(s), student number(s) name of tutor/supervisor, date of submission

* __Executive Summary / Abstract__
  * Concise summary of topic, question being answered, approach , results and implications
  * Usually needed for shorter communications or academic theirs, e.g article for final year projects
    * Aim is to entice someone to read it
  * Very short; typically 200-500 words, but check the requirements
  * Executive summary more common
    * A summary for "executives"
      * Executives don't have time to read all of your report
    * Limit to 1-2 pages
    * Critical information
      * Background/Summary of problem - ___Why?___
      * Approach - ___How?___
      * Results and discussion / chosen solution - __Findings__
      * Conclusions and recommendations - ___Implications___
    * Write to your audience
      * Maybe different to those reading they body of the report
    * > Written after the body of the report is completed
  * > Should be written last

* __Acknowledgements__
* __Table of contents__
  * List of sections and page numbers

* __List of figures__
* __List tables__
* __Glossary (e.g for acronyms, technical words)__

#### BODY

* __Introduction__
  * Purpose of the report and aims of the project
  * Definition of the problem
  * Scope of the project
    * What is _included_, _excluded_  
  * > Provide only relevant background information
* __Objectives / requirements__
* __Results__
  * What happened?
    * What was found?
    * What was NOT found?
  * NO Interpretation at this stage! Just Facts 
  * Units of measurement
  * Results in tables and figures should be described in the text
* __Discussion__
  * State/ identify the main research findings/themes
  * What are the reasons for the results?
  * Compare and contrast your results with others (e.g prior research)
    * How and why are they the _same/different_
  * Focus on the __Project Objectives__
* __Conclusions__
  * What are the key messages?
  * What does it all mean?
  * Address the `project objectives` and `scope`
  * Nothing new
    * No new results
    * No new discussion
  * Must be evidence based
    * __NO Fake News__
  * Order of points made can be important
* __Recommendations__
  * Recommendations carry degrees of risk
    * _should_, _could_, and _may_
  * Must be evidence based
  * Consider the `consequences`
    * Financial, environmental, and social
  * What should be done to achieve `recommendations`?

#### SUPPLEMENTS

* References
  * `Harvard` or `IEEE` style as per [library guidelines](./w3-referencing.md)
  * Reference list 
  * Sometimes included in a page / word limit
* Appendices
  * Supporting material
  * No normally included in a page / word limit 

> [!WARNING]
> Structures may vary depending on needs

### Contents

#### METHODOLOGY

* How were results produced?
  * Do not introduce any results
  * Avoid discussion
* Provide enough details so that the results can be repeated
* referencing to other work is acceptable

#### TABLES AND FIGURES

Used to communicate `data`
* Must have `captions`
* Must be referred to in the text
* __Key principles__:
  * "Less is more"
  * Reader should be able to interpret the `date` in a meaningful way, with limited explanation
  * Consistent formatting

##### Tables

* Not just about representing data
* Supports and highlights message through:
  * Clarity
  * Accessibility
  * A visual "_memory point_"
* Clean and simple, clear and brief
  * Avoid presenting too much
  * Remove unnecessary date
* Limit lines
  * Start with no lines, then add to distinguish
* Define `data` in `headings`
  * One line description best, with accurate and complete labels
* Order data meaningfully
* Significant figures
* Include a `captions` above the table

##### Figures

* Do you need a `figure`?
  * Would a `table` suffice?
* Clear and informative labels
* Appropriate labels on X/Y
* Include a `figure caption` below the figure
  * Include a cross reference in the text 
* Reader should not have to guess or interpret abbreviations
* `units` of measurement
* Eliminate items which do not assist in communicating meaning
* Avoid distortions / perspective changes
  * 3D plots often distort data

#### GRANTT CHART

* __Horizontal Bar Chart__ - developed as a production control tool in 1917 by Henry L. Grantt (American engineer and social scientist)
* __Graphical Illustration__ - of a schedule that helps to plan, coordinate and track specific task in a project
* `Horizontal axis` - representing the __total time span of the project__, broken down into increments (days, weeks, months)
* `Vertical axis` representing __the tasks that make up the project__
* Clear illustration of the project status __BUT DO NOT__ indicate task dependencies
* Horizontal bars of varying lengths represent the sequences, timing and time span for each task (bats may overlap)
* Simple versions can be created on graph paper or automated versions using MS `words`/`excel`


#### LANGUAGE

* Formal language
```
┌─────────┬─────────────┐
│NO       │ YES         │
├─────────┼─────────────┤
│Gone up  │ increased   │
├─────────┼─────────────┤
│Looked Up│ observed    │
├─────────┼─────────────┤
│Builds up│ Accuemulates│
└─────────┴─────────────┘
```

* Avoid contractions

```
┌─────┬─────────┐
│NO   │ YES     │
├─────┼─────────┤
│won't│ will not│
├─────┼─────────┤
│don't│ do not  │
└─────┴─────────┘
```
* NO Colloquial terms and buzzwords
* NO Aussie English
* Use consistent terminology
* Complete all `comparisions`
  * "The yields was higher in 2011"
  * "The yields was higher in 2011 than in 2010"
* Remove redundant verbs 
  * The results do indicate ...
  * The results indicate ...

## Tips for Success

`10 Thing to avoid from client's perspective`
1. No Executive Summary
2. or A badly written executive summary
3. Too muck details in the body of the report 
    * Improve readability and move some of it to an Appendix 
4. Copying ans Pasting from old reports
    * Errors get carried over
    * Cite your own work if you are going to do it
5. Lack of writing to the audience/purpose of the document
6. Writing very line, rambling backgrounds/introductions
    * Make it punchy
7. Sloppy grammar and spelling
8. Inconsistent language & formatting
8. The report does not answer the question
