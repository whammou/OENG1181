# EWB Challenge - Design Requirements

> __Ecotourism__
> Design Area 6 - Structures

Ecotourism is a form of tourism marketed as "responsible" travel (using what proponents say is sustainable transport) to natural areas, conserving the environment, and improving the well-being of the local people.[[1]](#1) The stated purpose may be to educate the traveler, to provide funds for ecological conservation, to directly benefit the economic development and political empowerment of local communities, or to foster respect for different cultures and human rights.

## Design Objectives

1. Develop culturally enriching and sustainable exchange programs that promote mutual understanding and respect between tourists and the community and people in the village.
2. Provide economic opportunities for local families through hosting tourists and offering cultural experiences.
3. Enhance the visibility and appreciation of the culture and heritage among visitors.
4. Support environmental conservation efforts by promoting responsible tourism practices and minimizing ecological footprint.
5. Ensure inclusively and accessibility of cultural exchange programs to individuals of all backgrounds and abilities.
6. Promote the sense of pride and ownership among the locals.

## Design Constraints

* Compliance with government regulations and permits related to tourism activities and home stay accommodations.
* Adherence to safety requirements to ensure the well-being of tourists and community members.
* Respect for the cultural norms and traditions of the local people, including sensitivity to religious practices and customs.
* Utilization of locally available materials and resources to minimize environmental impact and support the local economy.
* Consideration of seasonal variations and climate-related challenges when planning program activities.
* Accessibility: Programs must be designed with the inclusion of all members of the community, including those with disabilities.

## Design Considerations

### General Considerations

* __Sustainability__
  * Ensure that cultural exchange programs are conducted in a sustainable manner, respecting the cultural integrity and traditions of the Bunong people.
  * Implement guidelines for responsible tourism behavior to minimize negative impacts on the local community and environment.
  * Optimize resource usage and minimize environmental impact. By consolidating infrastructure, fewer materials and resources will be required for construction and maintenance.

* __Impact on Community__:
  * `(+)` Cultural exchange programs can have a positive impact on the community by providing additional income opportunities for local families hosting tourists.
  * `(+)`Empower local residents with skills and knowledge to actively participate in the tourism industry, leading to increased economic opportunities.  
  * `(-)` On the other hand, it may disrupt existing social dynamics and property rights.

* __Impact on Environment__: 
  * Prioritize environmental conservation and minimize ecological footprint.
  * Increased tourism activity may put additional pressure on natural resources if not managed properly. 

* __Community Engagement__:
  * Involve community members in the planning and implementation of cultural exchange programs to ensure their participation and support.
  * Seek feedback from local stakeholders to tailor programs to the cultural preferences and interests of the local people.

* __Cost and Economic Benefits__

  * `Capital Expenditure`:
    * Initial investment may be required for program development, including marketing, training, and infrastructure improvements.

  * `Operational Expenditure`:
    * Ongoing costs may include compensation for host families, program coordination, and maintenance of cultural sites.

  * `Economic Benefits`:
    * Generate income for local families and businesses, contributing to the local economy.  
    * Increased tourism revenue can support community development projects and infrastructure improvements.

* __Material and Access__:
  * Ensure that cultural exchange programs are accessible to all members of the community, including marginalized groups and individuals with disabilities.  
  * Locally available materials can be prioritized for construction to minimize transportation costs and support the local economy.

* __Delivery and Ongoing Management__:
  * Establish clear guidelines and protocols for cultural exchange programs, including safety measures, cultural sensitivity training, and conflict resolution mechanisms.  
  * Local builders and contractors can be engaged to construct the centralized host houses, with oversight and support from EWB. A management committee consisting of community members can be established to oversee the operation and maintenance of the facilities.

* __Inclusion of All__: 
  * The design should be inclusive and accessible to all members of the community, including those with disabilities or special needs. Considerations should be made to ensure that the facilities are barrier-free and accommodating to diverse user groups.

### Specific Considerations

#### 1. Education

* `Seasonality and Climate Change`
  * Integrate lessons on climate change adaptation and resilience into the curriculum to prepare the community for environmental challenges.
  * Emphasize the importance of sustainable resource management in the face of changing environmental conditions.
* `Cultural and Social Factors`
  * Ensuring educational content is culturally relevant and respectful of local traditions and customs.
  * Incorporating indigenous knowledge and perspectives into the curriculum to promote cultural appreciation and understanding.
* `Forest Preservation`
  * Educate locals about the importance of forest preservation and sustainable land management practices.
  * Promote alternative income-generating activities that do not rely on deforestation or habitat destruction.

#### 2. Infrastructures

* `Seasonality and Climate Change`: 
  * Centralized host houses should be designed to withstand seasonal variations and changing environmental conditions, such as increased rainfall or temperature fluctuations. Measures should be put in place to ensure the resilience and adaptability of the infrastructure over time.
* `Cultural and Social Factors`: 
  * The design of centralized host houses should be sensitive to the cultural and social practices of the Bunong people. Traditional architectural elements and cultural preferences should be incorporated into the design to maintain cultural identity and authenticity.
* `Forest Preservation`: 
  * Centralizing host houses can help reduce pressure on forest resources by concentrating human activities in specific areas. By minimizing the need for new construction in forested areas, this solution can contribute to forest preservation efforts and biodiversity conservation.

#### 3. Advertisement

* __Seasonality__: As mentioned, due to the natural climate of the local area the event is held in the _dry-season_. However, some considerations are made to hold such an event in the _wet-season_:
  * The `wetness` of the running lane can be mitigate using a simple roof for the whole lane
> Further information on the weather of the area is needed to implement such event during the _wet-season_

* __Forest Preservation__: The creation of the `running lane` can lead to cut down trees to the expand the lane or to plainly create the lane

* __Cultural and Social factors__: The increase in the visitors to the local ares can put stress on the local residents and infrastructures (e.g availability of the home stays [^1], too crowding leading to complication between locals and visitors

#### 4. Workshop and cultural exchange programs

* `Seasonality and Climate Change`
  * Consider seasonal variations and climate-related challenges when planning cultural exchange programs, such as extreme weather events or natural disasters.
  * Adapt program activities to accommodate changing environmental conditions and ensure the safety and well-being of participants.
* `Cultural and Social Factors`
  * Respect the cultural norms and traditions of the Bunong people when designing cultural exchange programs, including appropriate dress codes, behavior, and etiquette.
  * Encourage tourists to actively engage with local customs and traditions, such as participating in traditional ceremonies or learning indigenous skills and crafts.
* `Forest Preservation`
  * Promote cultural exchange activities that support sustainable land use practices and conservation efforts, such as guided forest walks or ecotourism initiatives.
  * Educate tourists about the importance of preserving the natural environment and biodiversity of the region, highlighting the cultural significance of forests to the Bunong people.
