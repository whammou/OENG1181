### 2. Infrastructures

#### 2.1 General Considerations

* __Sustainability__: 
Centralizing host houses can help optimize resource usage and minimize environmental impact. By consolidating infrastructure, fewer materials and resources will be required for construction and maintenance.
* __Impact on Community__: 
Centralized host houses may have both positive, it can create a sense of community and facilitate collaboration among hosts. On the other hand, it may disrupt existing social dynamics and property rights.
* __Impact on Environment__: 
Centralized infrastructure can reduce the overall footprint on the environment by concentrating development in specific areas.
* __Economic benefits__: 
Centralized host houses can attract more tourists and generate additional income for the community, leading to economic growth and development.
* __Material and Access__: 
Locally available materials can be prioritized for construction to minimize transportation costs and support the local economy.
* __Delivery and Ongoing Management__: 
Local builders and contractors can be engaged to construct the centralized host houses, with oversight and support from EWB. A management committee consisting of community members can be established to oversee the operation and maintenance of the facilities.
* __Inclusion of All__: 
he design of centralized host houses should be inclusive and accessible to all members of the community, including those with disabilities or special needs. Considerations should be made to ensure that the facilities are barrier-free and accommodating to diverse user groups.

#### 2.1 Specific Considerations
* `Seasonality and Climate Change`: 
Centralized host houses should be designed to withstand seasonal variations and changing environmental conditions, such as increased rainfall or temperature fluctuations. Measures should be put in place to ensure the resilience and adaptability of the infrastructure over time.
* `Cultural and Social Factors`: 
The design of centralized host houses should be sensitive to the cultural and social practices of the Bunong people. Traditional architectural elements and cultural preferences should be incorporated into the design to maintain cultural identity and authenticity.
* `Forest Preservation`: 
Centralizing host houses can help reduce pressure on forest resources by concentrating human activities in specific areas. By minimizing the need for new construction in forested areas, this solution can contribute to forest preservation efforts and biodiversity conservation.

### 3. Ad Campaign

#### 3.1 General Considerations

* __Sustainability__: Ensure that the `advertisement` campaign are conducted in a simple manner to ensure the replication of such event in the future
  * _Simple_: Requires few materials and minimal cost (e.g using available roads in the village instead of making a new one)

* __Impact on Community__: An ad campaign can have a positive impact on the community by improving the awareness about the local areas and provides an opportunities to further the local tourism

* __Impact on Environment__: An increase in tourism can be bring about the good and the bad to the local area
  * `(+)` Increasing awareness about the area and encourage funding to protect the wild lives in the area
  * `(-)` Roads are used in the events are not always readily available and sometimes have to be made `=>`if manage poorly could lead to deforestation and other complex influences on the environment

* __Community Engagement__: Running lane can be cultivate by the local workers. The task wouldn't so difficult that excess the expertise of the locals. Invoke awareness as to why the campaign is in the favor of the locals and not anybody else by hands out or talking to the villagers face-to-face

* __Economic Benefits__: Since the campaign is running in the favor of the locals it is natural that the village is the main benefactor. As to other, the campaign aims to provide the visitors/tourists with excellence experience

* __Material and Access__
  * `Material`: The campaign aims to prioritize the use of local materials such as local available roads for running lanes, primitive materials for constructions of barriers such as(e.g wood, metal, wool)
  * `Access`: The running lane is open for every candidate (e.g visitors, villagers, stakeholders, ..) 
    * Due to the nature of the local area the campaign aims to delivery in the _dry season_ to avoid other complication

* __Delivery and Ongoing Management__: Best human resources to management an ongoing event is the locals thus a protocol is established to exert safety for the event (e.g Trained locals will take on a roll as overseer during the event, the event can be remotely monitored via fly cam to take action asap in case complication arises, ...)

* __Inclusion of All__: The campaign aims are "simple", "effective", "accessible" to ensure that the event can be replicated in the future by the villagers and bring about the effectiveness, and accessible to everybody

#### 3.2 Specific Considerations

* __Seasonality__: As mentioned, due to the natural climate of the local area the event is held in the _dry-season_. However, some considerations are made to hold such an event in the _wet-season_:
  * The `wetness` of the running lane can be mitigate using a simple roof for the whole lane
> Further information on the weather of the area is needed to implement such event during the _wet-season_

* __Forest Preservation__: The creation of the `running lane` can lead to cut down trees to the expand the lane or to plainly create the lane

* __Cultural and Social factors__: The increase in the visitors to the local ares can put stress on the local residents and infrastructures (e.g availability of the home stays [^1], too crowding leading to complication between locals and visitors
