he design of centralized host houses should be inclusive and accessible to all members of the community, including those with disabilities or special needs. Considerations should be made to ensure that the facilities are barrier-free and accommodating to diverse user groups.

#### 2.1 Specific Considerations
* `Seasonality and Climate Change`: 
Centralized host houses should be designed to withstand seasonal variations and changing environmental conditions, such as increased rainfall or temperature fluctuations. Measures should be put in place to ensure the resilience and adaptability of the infrastructure over time.
* `Cultural and Social Factors`: 
The design of centralized host houses should be sensitive to the cultural and social practices of the Bunong people. Traditional architectural elements and cultural preferences should be incorporated into the design to maintain cultural identity and authenticity.
* `Forest Preservation`: 
Centralizing host houses can help reduce pressure on forest resources by concentrating human activities in specific areas. By minimizing the need for new construction in forested areas, this solution can contribute to forest preservation efforts and biodiversity conservation.
