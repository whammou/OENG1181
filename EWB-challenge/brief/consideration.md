## Design Considerations

### General Consideration

* __Sustainability__ - What measures could be put in place to ensure the successful continuation into the future
* __Impact on community__ - What impact will your design have on members of the community
* __Impacts on environment__ - What impact, both (+) and (-), will your design have on the local environment? By what measure
* __Community engagement__ - How would you propose `EWB` could potentially engage and consult the community throughout the project
* __Cost and economic benefits__ - What is the estimated cost of the project?
  * `Capital Expenditure` (initial cost to start)
  * `Operational Expenditure` (ongoing costs over time)
    * Material costs
    * Implementation costs
    * Operation/program delivery costs
  * Consider local currency 
  * Potential economic benefits
* __Material and Access__ - Transportation of protect materials and availability of material which might be required to future maintenance are a significant consideration
  * Consider using locally available materials
  * Consider where to import the materials from
* __Delivery and ongoing management__ - Who might construct/implement the project
* __Effective technical design__ - Is the technical design the most appropriate and effective for this context?
  * Take time to show what alternatives where considered any why you are proposing your design as the most appropriate
* __Inclusion of all__ - Is your proposed engagement approach, final product, and user experience inclusive of and accessible to all people

### Specific Considerations

* __Seasonality and Climate change__ - Design should be resilient to changes in environmental conditions pertaining to the region. Things to consider:
  * Water supply
  * Changing landscape
  * Increasingly hot land temperature in summer
* __Cultural and Social factor__ - Is your design appropriate and aligned with cultural and social practices of people within the communities of the indigenous `Bunong` people
* __Forest preservation__ - Take into account supporting people to earn income or use material in ways that are sustainable and preserves the forest
