<h2 id="design-considerations">Design Considerations</h2>
<h3 id="general-consideration">General Consideration</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainability</strong> - What measures could be put in palce to ensure the successful continuation into the future</li>
<li><strong>Impact on community</strong> - What impact will your design have on members of the community</li>
<li><strong>Impacts on environment</strong> - What impact, both (+) and (-), will your design have on the local environment? By what measure</li>
<li><strong>Community engagement</strong> - How would you propose <code>EWB</code> could potentially engage and consult the community throuhout the project</li>
<li><strong>Cost and economic benefits</strong> - What is the estimated cost of the proect?
<ul>
<li><code>Capital Expenditure</code> (initial cost to start)</li>
<li><code>Operational Expenditure</code> (ongoing costs over time)
<ul>
<li>Material costs</li>
<li>Implementation costs</li>
<li>Operation/program delivery costs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider local currency</li>
<li>Potential economic benefits</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Material and Access</strong> - Transportation of proect materials and availability of material which might be required to future maintenance are a significant consideration
<ul>
<li>Consider using locally available materials</li>
<li>Consider where to import the materials from</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Delivery and ongoing management</strong> - Who might construct/implement the project</li>
<li><strong>Effective technical design</strong> - Is the technical design the most appropricate and effective for this context?
<ul>
<li>Take time to show what alternatives where tocnsdered any why you are proposing your design as the the most appropriate</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Inclusion of all</strong> - Is your proposed engagement approach, final product, and user experience inclusive of and accessible to all people</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specific-considerations">Specific Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seasonality and Climate change</strong> - Design should be resilient to changes in environmental conditions pertaining to the region. Things to consider:
<ul>
<li>Water supply</li>
<li>Changing landscape</li>
<li>Increasingly hot land temperature in summer</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cultural and Social factor</strong> - Is your design appropriate and aligned with cultural and social practices of people within the communities of the indigenous <code>Bunong</code> people</li>
<li><strong>Forest preservation</strong> - Take into account supporting people to earn income or use material in ways that are sustainable and preserves the forest</li>
</ul>
