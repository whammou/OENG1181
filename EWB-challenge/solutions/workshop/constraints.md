   - High dropout rates in Pu Ngaol may be indicative of low literacy levels among the population, necessitating the use of visual aids and simplified language during the workshop.

5. **Limited Community Engagement:**
   - Low participation rates and community engagement may be a result of distrust or disinterest in external initiatives, requiring extensive outreach and collaboration with local leaders to gain trust and involvement.

6. **Time Constraints:**
   - Limited availability of participants due to familial and agricultural responsibilities may require flexible scheduling of the workshop sessions to accommodate the needs of the community.

8. **Sustainability Considerations:**
   - Ensuring the sustainability of the workshop outcomes in the long term, including the continued adoption of material-efficient woodwork practices, may require ongoing support and follow-up activities.

9. **Environmental Impact:**
   - Implementation of sustainable woodwork practices should consider the local ecosystem and avoid detrimental effects on the environment, such as overharvesting of timber resources.

10. **Community Empowerment:**
    - Building local capacity and empowering community members to take ownership of sustainable practices may require tailored approaches that consider the socio-economic context and aspirations of the people of Pu Ngaol.

Addressing these constraints will be crucial in designing and delivering a workshop that effectively engages the community of Pu Ngaol, promotes sustainable woodwork practices, and contributes to the long-term development and well-being of the area despite the challenges presented by its remote and disadvantaged status.
