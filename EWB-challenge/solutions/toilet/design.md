# Preliminary Design - UDDT

> Design on "Urine-Diverting Dry Toilet"

## Embodiment Design

### Function Analysis

```
Sitting toilets, often referred to as ‘Western toilet
s’, have been established as the norm in most of Euro
pe, North and South America, Russia, Australia etc. C
onversely, squatting toilets are the norm in most Asi
an and African countries.

> [!NOTE]
> A mix of `urine` and `faeces` causes substantial odour

1. Enable fast drying of `faeces` which makes handling of `faeces` more __simple__ and __hygienic__
2. Reduce environmental impacts
3. Allow recovery of `urine` which can be reuse fertiliser

> __The core function of a UDDT is to separate urine and faeces__

#### Toilet Seat

The most important component of `UDDT` is the `seat` which allow __separation__ of `urine` and `faeces`

#### Faeces Vault

The `UDDT` vaults serve the basic function of collecting and storing the `faeces` 

1. The `faeces` needs to be safely __stored__ in the `vaults` so that they can be hygienically separated from human contact
    * This requires a vault door or other means of __blocking__ both direct and indirect human or animal contact, while allowing intermittent access to the vault for emptying and cleaning activities
    * The vault also stores toilet paper and cover materials

2. The second important function of the vault is to __provide a dry (low moisture) conditions__ to allow the `faeces` to become and remain dry odourless
    * This is accomplished by installing the vaults above ground to avoid rain and water from entering the vault
    * Moreover this vaults should be adequately ventilated to exhaust moisture and odours
