##### 3.2 Screening

* The `preliminary screening` is used to weed down the multiple design options into slightly fewer options by asking a simple question _Does this option meet all of the Design Constraints_  if the answer is NO, then the design option should be rejected

* `Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)` is suite of tools used in many parts of life to help with decision making, specifically when there is more than one criteria
